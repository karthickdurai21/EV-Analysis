* **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for creating calculated columns, measures, and KPIs


### ðŸ“ˆ Key KPIs & Insights

* **Total Vehicles:** 150.06K
* **Average Electric Range:** 67.84 miles
* **BEV Vehicles:** 117K (78%)
* **PHEV Vehicles:** 34K (22%)
* **Model Year Trend:** Sharp growth observed from 2015 to 2022
* **Top Manufacturers:** Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, BMW, etc.
* **CAFV Eligibility Breakdown** â€“ showing clean alternative fuel qualifications


### ðŸ“‚ Dashboard Features

* **Interactive Filters**: City, Utility, and Vehicle Type selectors
* **Line Chart**: Total vehicles trend by model year
* **Bar Chart**: Top EV manufacturers
* **Pie & Donut Charts**: Eligibility and vehicle type breakdown
* **Tree Map**: Vehicles by individual model


### ðŸ“Œ Business Impact

This dashboard provides stakeholders with a detailed understanding of electric vehicle adoption across locations and manufacturers. It helps government or energy agencies:
